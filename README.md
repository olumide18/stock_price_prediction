**Title: Stock Price Prediction using LSTM**

**Abstract:**
This study explores the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in predicting stock prices. The journey began with data collection using the Pandas DataReader, followed by preprocessing steps like standard scaling to ensure uniformity across features. Initially, traditional machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) were experimented with, but later transitioned to deep learning techniques with TensorFlow for better performance.

**Objective:**
The main goal was to develop a robust predictive model capable of forecasting future stock prices accurately. By utilizing LSTM networks, the objective was to capture intricate patterns and dependencies within the historical stock data, thus enhancing prediction accuracy.

**Methodology:**
1. **Data Collection:** Initially, historical stock price data was obtained using the Pandas DataReader from various financial sources.
2. **Preprocessing:** Standard scaling was applied to normalize the data, ensuring that all features contribute uniformly to the model.
3. **Model Training:** Traditional machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) were initially explored. However, given the sequential nature of stock price data, LSTM networks were later adopted.
4. **Deep Learning with TensorFlow:** LSTM networks were implemented using TensorFlow, a powerful framework for building and training neural networks. This allowed the model to learn intricate temporal patterns present in the data.

**Results:**
The LSTM-based model outperformed traditional machine learning approaches, exhibiting higher accuracy in predicting future stock prices. By leveraging the temporal dependencies inherent in the data, the model achieved improved forecasting capabilities. This demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning techniques, particularly LSTM networks, in stock price prediction tasks.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, this study highlights the efficacy of LSTM networks in predicting stock prices. By incorporating deep learning techniques, notably TensorFlow, the model was able to capture complex patterns and dependencies within the data, leading to more accurate forecasts. This research contributes to the advancement of predictive analytics in financial markets, offering valuable insights for investors and traders.
